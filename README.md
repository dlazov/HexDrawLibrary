Basic HexDraw Library

Notes:
==============
This basic library I created using Jo Bader's HexDraw program.

http://www.hexdraw.com/

The artwork and the color schemes I used I 'borrowed' from VASL and or the VASL Map making secrets.

Folders
==============
I created three folders in my HexDraw folder location (Exports, Maps and Overlays). I use these as: 

Exports = exported images, these I tested as 1x export.
Maps = where I store my default ASL map templates.
Overlays = where I stored the buildings, orchards, gullies and other artwork I 'borrowed' from VASL.

Templates
==============
In the Maps directory I have three main templates:

ASL-Base-17x20a-GeoMap-Blank-Template.hm

ASL-Base-17x20b-GeoMap-Blank-Template.hm

ASL-Base-GeoMap-Blank-Template.hm

Usage
==============
The way I use HexDraw is after I launch the program I then open up a default template and then I start making the map changes I like to or want to make and then I save it as a new Map (DGL-Geo-03 for example) and then continue editing. Thus far each template has the exact (or should) set of default values and then this can be used in the further creation of new maps.

If you modify a new map (by changing or adding a color the templates won't pick it up, like wise if you modify a template and then save it you'll loose the template and have to re-download it.

Final Thoughts
==============

I don't mind sharing this and I hope others will pick it up and take the grunt work I have done and enhance it for the benefit for the community.

Cheers.
